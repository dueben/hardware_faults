In this repository model code of a shallow water model is presented that is made resilient against hardware faults using a backup grid. The changes that are necessary to enable an emulator for reduced numerical precision ( http://github.com/aopp-pred/rpe ) to mimic the use of hardware that shows random bit flips are also provided.
